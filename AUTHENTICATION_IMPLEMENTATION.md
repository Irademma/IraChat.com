## ✅ **What's Been Implemented**

### 🔒 **Secure Token Storage**
- **expo-secure-store** integration for encrypted credential storage
- Tokens stored with 7-day expiration (configurable)
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android/Web)

### 🚀 **Auto-Login Flow**
- App checks for stored authentication on launch
- Automatic sign-in if valid token exists
- Seamless redirect to main app or welcome screen
- Loading states with user feedback

### 💾 **Persistent User Data**
- Complete user profile stored securely
- Survives app restarts and device reboots
- Automatic data synchronization
- Redux state management integration

### 🔄 **Smart Authentication Management**
- Registration automatically stores auth data
- Login persists across app sessions
- Logout properly clears all stored data
- Error handling for corrupted/expired tokens

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **App Launch Flow:**

2. Valid token found → Auto-sign in → Main app
3. No/expired token → Welcome screen
```

### **Registration Flow:**
```
1. User creates account → Store auth data securely
2. Update Redux store → Navigate to main app
3. User stays signed in on future launches
```

### **Logout Flow:**
```
1. User clicks logout → Clear stored data
2. Sign out from Firebase → Update Redux
3. Navigate to welcome screen
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Implementation**

### **Test Auto-Login:**
1. Register a new account
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app
4. ✅ Should go directly to main app (no login screen)

### **Test Logout:**
1. From main app, click logout
2. Confirm logout
3. ✅ Should redirect to welcome screen
4. ✅ Next app launch should show welcome screen

### **Test Token Expiration:**
1. Register account
2. Wait 7 days (or modify expiration in code for testing)
3. Reopen app
4. ✅ Should redirect to welcome screen (expired token)
