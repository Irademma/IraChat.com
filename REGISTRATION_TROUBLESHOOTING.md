# 🔧 Registration Error Troubleshooting Guide

## ❌ **Error: "Failed to create account. Please try again."**

This error has been **FIXED**! Here's what was causing it and how it's been resolved:

---

## 🐛 **Root Causes Identified & Fixed**

### 1️⃣ **ProfilePicturePicker Prop Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Component expected `currentImage` prop but received `value`
- **Fix**: Changed `value={profilePicture}` to `currentImage={profilePicture}`

### 2️⃣ **PhoneNumberInput Type Error** ✅ FIXED  
- **Issue**: Error prop type mismatch (string vs boolean)
- **Fix**: Changed `error={error && !phoneNumber.trim()}` to `error={!!(error && !phoneNumber.trim())}`

### 3️⃣ **Storage Fallback Implementation** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: expo-secure-store might not be available in all environments
- **Fix**: Added fallback storage system (SecureStore → AsyncStorage → localStorage)

### 4️⃣ **Enhanced Error Logging** ✅ ADDED
- **Issue**: Generic error messages hiding actual problems
- **Fix**: Added detailed error logging and specific error messages
